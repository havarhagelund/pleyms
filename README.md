One of my good friends likes to always invite people over for dinner, after he also bought a pizza oven, the joke about the Pleyms resteurant was born.

This project is first and foremost an internal joke in our friend group, but also a fun way to play around with Astro.

Built with Astro, deployed on Vercel.
